# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub! (We all have to start somewhere, right?)

Today I join the enormous galaxy of GitHub and its related projects (no pun intended). I'm interested (and a little excited) to see what becomes of this journey.

I was blessed to join the programming community at one of the most amazing times in computing history. I've shown up for one incredible journey - and by the looks of things, I have no time to waste! Time for me to get cracking!
